# Ecommerce Website

![Preview for the Ecommerce Website](./preview.png)

An Ecommerce Website that I built using the MERN stack. It's a fun and hands-on way for me to explore different technologies. I used MongoDB for the database, Express.js for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and Node.js to tie everything together. It's been a great learning experience.

## Features

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser
